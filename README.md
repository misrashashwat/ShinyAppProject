## Algorithm Used: Random Forest Algorithm
<sub>Random Forest algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm. It is mainly used for classification and regression problems. As the name suggest it consist of multiple decision trees which make the decision collectively. The random forest algorithm makes different amount of trees with the combination of all the variables in the data said so that every factor gets a chance to be a root node or to be included in the modelling.
  
## Steps involved in Random Forest Algorithm:
<sub> Step 1: In Random forest n number of random records are taken from the data set having k number of records.

<sub> Step 2: Individual decision trees are constructed for each sample.

<sub> Step 3: Each decision tree will generate an output.

<sub> Step 4: Final output is considered based on Majority Voting or Averaging for Classification and regression respectively.
  
## Dataset Used: Diabetes Testing
<sub>The motive behind choosing this dateset was that it has ample amount of factors that can be included in the random forest algorithm as well as this dataset is a good example for a classification problem.
## Motive:
<sub>The motive behind choosing this problem was that making machine learning program nowadays that can predict medical problems just by taking few readings and information about the patient is very useful and I aimed to make a good fitted model out of the dataset. Since the data had many missing values are removed the rows consisting of the missing values as a part of data preprocessing.I chose the Data from the trending section of the Kaggle.com.
