Algorithm Used: Random Forest Algorithm
Random Forest algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm. It is mainly used for classification and regression problems. As the name suggest it consist of multiple decision trees which make the decision collectively. The random forest algorithm makes different amount of trees with the combination of all the variables in the data said so that every factor gets a chance to be a root node or to be included in the modelling. 
Dataset Used: Diabetes Testing
Motive: The motive behind choosing this dateset was that it has ample amount of factors that can be included in the random forest algorithm as well as this dataset is a good example for a classification problem.
